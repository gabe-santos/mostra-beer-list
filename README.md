# Brewgle Sheets üç∫

A beer menu that connects Google Sheets to a web app, allowing users to update a taplist in a spreadsheet and display it online automatically.

## Motivation
While working at a coffeeshop that served beer, we faced the constant challenge of updating and printing new taplists with each change in our draft offerings. Seeking a more efficient solution, I developed a web app designed to display an always-up-to-date taplist online. To streamline the process and leverage existing practices, I integrated Google Sheets as the backend database, capitalizing on our familiarity and existing use of Google Sheets for inventory management.
